# Project Overview
This site is being developed for the Code Fellows 201 lab called BusMall. 
This site has a user select an item out of three options, 25 times. It then stores that data in Local Storage, shows it to the user in text form and in the form of a chart, and accesses it if the user refreshes the page and selects a new set of 25.

# Reflections and Comments
I feel like a lot of the structures we worked with in this lab can be applied to so many other projects, specifically our goals in the upcoming project week.
